# Tweet Sentiment Analysis and Entity Extraction for Hackbridge

This repository contains a Python script for analyzing financial news sentiment and extracting entities such as price and time targets from a dataset. The script is designed to preprocess the input data, classify sentiment using a pre-trained model, adjust sentiment based on keywords, and extract relevant entities using named entity recognition (NER) techniques.

## Dependencies 

Before running the script, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python3
pandas
scikit-learn
spaCy
transformers
torch
You can install these dependencies using pip:

bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn spacy transformers torch


## Usage

1. Input Data: Prepare your financial news dataset in CSV format. Each row should contain a 'content' column with the text of the news article.

2. Adjust Parameters: Optionally, adjust parameters such as input/output file paths, batch size, and thresholds for sentiment classification according to your requirements.

3. Run the Script: Execute the provided Python script. It will load the dataset, process it in batches, classify sentiment, adjust sentiment based on keywords, extract entities, and save the results to a new CSV file.

```bash
python financial_sentiment_analysis.py
```

## Customization

- Preprocessing: You can modify the `preprocess_text` function to add additional text cleaning or preprocessing steps.
- Sentiment Classification: Adjust the `positive_threshold` and `negative_threshold` variables to control the thresholds for classifying sentiment.
- Keyword Adjustment: Modify the lists `positive_keywords` and `negative_keywords` to add or remove keywords used for adjusting sentiment.
- Entity Extraction: Customize the `extract_entities` function to enhance entity extraction based on your specific requirements.

## Note

This script utilizes a pre-trained sentiment classification model and a named entity recognition (NER) model.
